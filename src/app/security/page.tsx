The flag is read at request time so operators can flip it without restarting the process. Every denial is logged at WARNING for incident-response audit. The 10 built-in specialist agents remain available. Designed for regulated deployments where end-user agent customization isn't acceptable.",

Every call emits a structured INFO log with tool, server, status (ok/fail/denied), and elapsed time, plus a Sentry breadcrumb. Denials happen before the wire — the policy fires at the FastAPI dependency layer. Both env vars are read per call so operators can flip without restart. The governance layer is the differentiator vs other platforms whose MCP clients have no allowlist or audit.",

    detail: "A sliding-window rate limiter enforces per-client quotas via the X-Client-ID header. Default limits are 20 req/min for the GUI, 80 req/min for trading agents, and 10 req/min for unknown clients. Path-specific limits protect ingestion and agent endpoints from abuse. All limits are configurable via CONSUMER_REGISTRY.",

Docker containers have memory and CPU resource limits. Nginx and optional Caddy reverse proxy add security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security).",
